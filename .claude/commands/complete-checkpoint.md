# Complete Checkpoint Command

Completes the development checkpoint by consolidating work log entries into project status when a previous `/commit-work --code-only` was used.

## Usage
```
/complete-checkpoint [user_notes]
/complete-checkpoint "additional context about the implementation impact"
/complete-checkpoint  # Standard consolidation
```

## When to Use:

This command is only needed when the previous `/commit-work` used the `--code-only` flag:

```bash
# Previous session
/commit-work --code-only "experimental feature, needs validation"

# Later, when ready to complete checkpoint
/complete-checkpoint "validation completed, feature is production-ready"
```

## What it does:

1. **Consolidates Work Log**:
   - Takes entries from WORK_LOG.md 
   - Adds new section to docs/status.md "Last Completed Work"
   - Maintains chronological order and established format

2. **Updates Project Status**:
   - Updates "System Status" if new capabilities were added
   - Updates "Current State" to reflect completed work
   - Moves resolved items from "Pending Issues" if applicable
   - Preserves existing project status structure

3. **Clears Work Log**:
   - Resets WORK_LOG.md to empty template
   - Prepares for next development session
   - Maintains clean development cycle

4. **Creates Status Commit**:
   - Stages docs/status.md and WORK_LOG.md
   - Auto-generates administrative commit message
   - Completes the two-commit checkpoint pattern

## Parameters:

### `user_notes` (Optional)
**Type**: Literal text addition to status update
**Purpose**: Provides additional context for the status consolidation
**Examples**:
- `"validation completed, feature is production-ready"`
- `"performance testing shows 40% improvement"`
- `"integration testing revealed edge case fixes needed"`

## Auto-Generation Process:

1. **Analyzes Work Log Content**:
   - Identifies key accomplishments and changes
   - Extracts file modifications and test results
   - Determines impact on system capabilities

2. **Generates Status Update**:
   - Creates descriptive section title
   - Organizes bullet points by importance
   - Includes technical details and metrics
   - Follows established status document format

3. **Creates Commit Message**:
   - Standard administrative commit format
   - References consolidated work period
   - Maintains git history clarity

## Example Output:

**docs/status.md addition**:
```markdown
**TOC Detection Implementation (Phase 2.5)**:
- Enhanced HeaderFooterAnalysisState to 6-objective analysis including TOC detection
- Fixed critical implementation issues: save_json import and field consistency
- Created comprehensive testing framework with boundary-focused mocking
- All 11/11 TOC tests + 23/23 additional section heading tests passing
- Additional context: validation completed, feature is production-ready
```

**Commit created**:
```
"Update project status and clear work log

Consolidated work log entries from TOC detection implementation phase.
Status updated to reflect completed Phase 2.5 with testing validation."
```

## Workflow Integration:

**Normal Flow** (automatic):
```bash
/commit-work  # Does everything - no need for /complete-checkpoint
```

**Edge Case Flow**:
```bash
/commit-work --code-only     # Implementation only
# ... additional testing/validation ...
/complete-checkpoint         # Complete the checkpoint
```

## Error Handling:
- Warns if no work log entries exist to consolidate
- Checks if previous implementation commit exists
- Validates docs/status.md structure before modification
- Provides clear feedback about checkpoint completion status
