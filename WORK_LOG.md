### 2025-07-25 15:53 - State Machine Integration and CLI Default Path Switch
- **Completed**: 
  - Fixed CLI extraction issue in src/pdf_plumb/cli.py (lines 596-602) for state machine workflow results
  - Switched default LLM analysis path from direct analyzer to state machine workflow
  - Changed CLI flag from --use-state-machine to --use-direct-analyzer (legacy path)
  - Added reproducible sampling with --sampling-seed parameter for testing
  - Verified identical LLM requests between both implementations using seed 42
  - Updated docs/status.md with Phase 2.4 State Machine Integration status
  - Added TODO note to eventually remove direct analyzer path after validation period
- **Tests**: Both CLI paths tested successfully with seed 42 - identical results (High/High confidence, same content boundaries, ~70K tokens)
- **Next**: State machine is now production default, direct analyzer available as legacy fallback
  - Created comprehensive HeaderFooterAnalysisState (222 lines) in src/pdf_plumb/workflow/states/header_footer.py with provider configuration, cost estimation, and document validation
  - Enhanced LLMDocumentAnalyzer with sampling_seed parameter support for reproducible testing
  - Updated state registry (src/pdf_plumb/workflow/registry.py) and exports (src/pdf_plumb/workflow/states/__init__.py)
  - Created test_state_comparison.py (254 lines) - comprehensive comparison testing framework with JSON report generation
  - Updated docs/design-decisions.md Section 9 with implementation details and completion status
  - Updated docs/design/STATE_MACHINE_ARCHITECTURE.md with 70+ line section on loop prevention and transition restrictions
