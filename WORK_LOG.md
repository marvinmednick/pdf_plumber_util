### 2025-07-24 17:34 - Update CLAUDE.md documentation references and add session startup guidance
- **Completed**: Fixed all incorrect document references in CLAUDE.md (CLI_USAGE.md → docs/cli-usage.md, STATUS.md → docs/status.md, etc.), added WORK_LOG.md to core documentation list, created comprehensive Session Startup Guidance section for Claude Code context, updated Work Log Protocol to include creating empty WORK_LOG.md after commits
- **Tests**: No tests needed for documentation updates
- **Next**: Should create empty WORK_LOG.md file since one doesn't currently exist
