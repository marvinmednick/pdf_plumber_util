### 2025-09-24 23:43 - Pattern Detection Architecture Implementation - Phase 1 Core Components
- **Completed**: Implemented core pattern detection components and updated state machine integration
- **Files Created**:
  - src/pdf_plumb/core/pattern_manager.py: PatternSetManager with configurable regex patterns (318 lines)
  - src/pdf_plumb/core/document_scanner.py: DocumentScanner for full-document pattern matching (582 lines)
- **Files Modified**: 
  - src/pdf_plumb/workflow/states/header_footer.py: Updated HeaderFooterAnalysisState for comprehensive pattern analysis (165 lines modified)
- **Architecture Enhancement**: Integrated three-phase pattern detection (programmatic preprocessing → LLM analysis → knowledge integration)
- **Implementation Status**: Core infrastructure complete, ready for LLM prompt enhancement and response parsing
- **Next**: Update LLM prompt templates and response parser for comprehensive pattern analysis

### 2025-09-25 00:08 - Pattern Detection System Analysis and Spacing Issue Discovery
- **Completed**: Comprehensive pattern detection system with 30 patterns covering diverse document types
- **Major Discovery**: Identified PDF text extraction spacing issue - 12.2pt positional gaps not preserved as spaces
- **Analysis Results**: 
  - 30 high-quality pattern matches in H.264 document (up from 12)
  - 18 Annex subsection headings detected (A.1 → A.3.1 hierarchy)
  - 5 different pattern types working together successfully
  - Cross-document validation on Academic, Legal, Manual, Research document types
- **Technical Issue Found**: Text segment concatenation loses positional spacing (9.3.4.6[space]Byte becomes 9.3.4.6Byte)
- **Root Cause**: 12.2pt gap between segments represents space but gets lost during extraction
- **Files Enhanced**: 
  - pattern_manager.py: 20 comprehensive section patterns + 11 other pattern types
  - test_comprehensive_patterns.py: Cross-document validation testing (318 lines)
- **Next**: Fix spacing reconstruction from segment positions, then continue with LLM prompt enhancement

### 2025-09-25 11:37 - PDF Text Spacing Reconstruction Design
- **Completed**: Analyzed PDF text extraction spacing issue where segment concatenation loses positional gaps
- **Root Cause Identified**: Line construction in extractor.py:244 ignores gaps between text segments, causing "9.3.4.6Byte" instead of "9.3.4.6 Byte"
- **Solution Design**: Proportional spacing algorithm that:
  - Continues ignoring empty segments (confirmed current behavior)
  - Uses segment positional data to calculate gaps between non-empty segments  
  - Creates dual text versions: normalized (single spaces) and proportional (multiple spaces)
  - Maps spacing positions to character indices in normalized text for downstream analysis
- **Implementation Target**: _process_words method line construction logic
- **Files to Modify**: src/pdf_plumb/core/extractor.py
- **Next**: Implement proportional spacing reconstruction algorithm
---
### 2025-09-25 12:31 - Spacing Reconstruction Implementation Complete
- **Completed**: Full spacing reconstruction system with comprehensive testing and documentation
- **Implementation**: 
  - Enhanced extractor.py with _build_line_with_proportional_spacing method (68 lines)
  - Dual text output: normalized (single spaces) + proportional (multiple spaces)
  - Spacing metadata preservation with gap calculations and font-adaptive thresholds
- **Test Infrastructure**: 
  - Created comprehensive test fixture: tests/fixtures/test_spacing_reconstruction.json (8 test cases)
  - Added unit tests: tests/unit/test_spacing_reconstruction.py (9 test methods, all passing)
  - Moved standalone scripts to proper test structure: tests/integration/test_pattern_detection.py
- **Documentation Enhancement**:
  - Renamed and enhanced: docs/design/BLOCK_GROUPING.md → TEXT_PROCESSING_AND_BLOCK_GROUPING.md
  - Added Part I: Text Segment Processing with complete algorithm documentation
  - Updated CLAUDE.md references and cross-reference examples
- **Validation Results**:
  - Pattern detection tests: 25 total matches (improved from broken patterns)
  - Spacing reconstruction tests: 9/9 passing (covers H.264 issue + edge cases)
  - Unit test suite: 39/39 passing (no regressions)
  - H.264 section spacing fix confirmed: '9.3.4.6Byte' → '9.3.4.6 Byte'
- **Design Decisions Documented**:
  - Space-only segments treated as empty (avoids double-counting)
  - Font-adaptive space estimation (font_size * 0.3 space width ratio)
  - Edge case handling: overlapping segments, mixed fonts, consecutive empties
- **Files Modified/Created**: 9 total files (4 modified, 3 moved, 2 created)
- **Next**: Spacing reconstruction ready for production use, pattern detection accuracy significantly improved
