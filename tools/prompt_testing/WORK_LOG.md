### 2025-09-28 09:19 - Context Window Analysis and Validation Complete
- **Key Insight**: User's understanding validated - most decisions (90%) are content-based from line analysis with minimal context
- **Context Requirements**: TOC needs 3-5 lines (not full page), sections need target+1 line, tables/figures need line content only
- **Confidence Mechanics**: Font weight + prefix patterns + formatting + local sequence consistency with quantifiable thresholds
- **Implementation Simplification**: Line-level pattern analysis → minimal context validation → full context only for <10% low-confidence cases

### 2025-09-28 11:50 - Accuracy-Focused Template Analysis Complete  
- **Refocus**: Identified efficiency optimization drift from primary goal of fixing false positive accuracy issues
- **Core Problem**: Templates are pattern matchers without semantic understanding - recognize formatting but not document purpose
- **Accuracy Issues**: 90% false positive rate (sections on TOC), 65% false positive rate (TOC on lists), consistent equation false positives
- **Root Cause**: Pattern recognition ≠ semantic understanding of document context and content relationships  
- **Strategic Solution**: Two-stage semantic validation with context-aware templates and cross-contamination prevention
- **Implementation Focus**: Context-aware prompting, negative examples, document purpose validation, cross-type prevention rules
- **Goal**: Transform pattern matchers into semantic analyzers that understand WHAT patterns MEAN in document contexts
- **Next**: Design context-aware templates with semantic validation logic to achieve <5% false positive rates
