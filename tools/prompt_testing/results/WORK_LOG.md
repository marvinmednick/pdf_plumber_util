- **Completed**: Enhanced generic test runner to output properly formatted JSON instead of string-embedded JSON
- **Improvement**: Response content now parsed and saved as structured JSON enabling jq processing and analysis
- **Testing**: Validated jq compatibility - can extract counts, specific fields, and perform complex queries on results
- **Files Modified**: tools/prompt_testing/generic_test_runner.py - added JSON parsing for response_content with error handling
- **Benefits**: Easier analysis, template performance comparison, content extraction, and report generation
- **jq Examples**: Count items, extract section numbers, list equation references - all now possible with standard JSON tools

### 2025-09-28 13:25 - Equation Classification Refinement Complete
- **Completed**: Enhanced equation handling in comprehensive template to properly distinguish references from content
- **Key Improvements**: Empty titles for numbered equations without names, proper layout pattern support, standard mathematical document conventions
- **Template Updates**: Enhanced equation section with multiple layout patterns, title positioning rules, reference vs content distinction
- **Testing**: Validated on page 50 - all 5 equations now correctly show empty titles instead of using equation content as title
- **Files Modified**: tools/prompt_testing/templates/comprehensive_content_analysis.txt - improved equation section and JSON examples
- **Results**: Proper equation reference extraction (6-11, 6-12, 6-13, 6-14, 6-15) with correct empty titles
- **Production Ready**: Template now handles all major content types with semantic accuracy and proper classification
- **Next**: Document comprehensive accuracy improvements for deployment
