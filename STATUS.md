# PDF Plumb Project Status

## Current Development Status: Production-Ready with LLM Integration

**Last Updated**: January 2025  
**Current Focus**: Documentation organization and maintenance

## Development Phases

- **Phase 1**: Foundation Modernization (Complete) - See [PHASE_HISTORY.md](PHASE_HISTORY.md#phase-1-foundation-modernization)
- **Phase 2.1**: CLI Framework Migration (Complete) - See [PHASE_HISTORY.md](PHASE_HISTORY.md#phase-21-cli-framework-migration)  
- **Phase 2.2**: Enhanced Error Handling (Complete) - See [PHASE_HISTORY.md](PHASE_HISTORY.md#phase-22-enhanced-error-handling)
- **Phase 2.3**: Performance Optimization (Complete) - See [PHASE_HISTORY.md](PHASE_HISTORY.md#phase-23-performance-optimization)
- **Phase 3.0**: LLM Integration (Complete) - See [PHASE_HISTORY.md](PHASE_HISTORY.md#phase-30-llm-integration)

## Current System Status

**Core Functionality**: Production-ready and stable
- ✅ Word-based extraction with contextual spacing analysis
- ✅ Intelligent block formation and document structure detection
- ✅ Modern Click + Rich CLI with document type profiles
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling with retry mechanisms
- ✅ Performance optimized with sub-linear scaling

**LLM Integration**: Fully operational
- ✅ Azure OpenAI integration with GPT-4.1 support
- ✅ `llm-analyze` CLI command with cost estimation
- ✅ Strategic page sampling for efficient analysis
- ✅ Header/footer content-aware detection
- ✅ Token counting and batch optimization

**Architecture**: Modern and extensible
- ✅ Hybrid approach combining programmatic precision with LLM content understanding
- ✅ Contextual spacing analysis as preferred method
- ✅ Flexible configuration with profiles, environment variables, CLI overrides
- ✅ Clean dependency management with license-friendly core libraries

## Current Activity

**State Machine Architecture Design (January 2025)**:
- Designing state machine orchestrator for multi-objective analysis workflows
- Architecture documentation and design patterns
- Planning migration from simple iterative processing to flexible state-based system
- Foundation for advanced LLM workflow orchestration

See: [design/STATE_MACHINE_ARCHITECTURE.md](design/STATE_MACHINE_ARCHITECTURE.md)

## Performance & Quality Status

**Performance**: 12.5s for 20-page documents, sub-linear scaling validated  
**Testing**: 28+ passing tests with comprehensive error handling coverage  
**Code Quality**: Well-structured, documented, maintainable codebase  
**Usability**: Professional CLI experience with Rich console integration

## Known Technical Debt (Low Priority)

- Traditional header/footer method removal (contextual method validated as preferred)
- PyMuPDF dependency isolation (visualization only, development use)
- Extraction method comparison cleanup (consider removing from production pipeline)

## Next Phase Planning

**Status**: No immediate development planned  
**Trigger Conditions**: New requirements, user feedback, or performance needs  
**Potential Areas**: API interface, additional LLM providers, advanced visualization features
