# PDF Plumb Project Status

## Current State

**System Status**: Word-based extraction, contextual block formation, spacing gap analysis, LLM-based header/footer detection, LLM section heading and table/figure analysis, state machine architecture for multi-pass analysis  
**Active Work**: Test docstring improvements complete - focus on duplicate element detection issue

## Last Completed Work

**Test Documentation System**:
- Enhanced test docstrings across 4 test files following established guidelines (docs/test_docstring_guidelines.md)
- Added comprehensive 5-section format for complex tests (setup, verification, limitations, key insights)
- Improved 35+ test methods with detailed explanations and specific validation details
- All test files now have consistent, maintainable documentation standards

**Work Log System Implementation**:
- Created WORK_LOG.md for tracking development progress during active sessions
- Added mandatory work log protocol to CLAUDE.md with bash append commands
- Established commit-time consolidation process to maintain STATUS.md accuracy
- Provides context continuity for effective Claude Code collaboration

**Documentation Reorganization**:
- Implemented mkdocs-gen-files for dynamic README/CLAUDE.md transformation
- Fixed phase history anchor tags by moving "âœ… COMPLETE" status to separate lines
- Resolved mkdocs build warnings for missing readme.md and development.md files
- All documentation now builds successfully with proper link transformation

**State Machine Architecture**:
- Complete state machine orchestrator implementation with AnalysisState base class
- Fixed MAX_TOTAL_STATES constant (50) to prevent infinite loops
- Removed unused retry functionality to simplify codebase (87 tests now passing)

## Current Functionality

**PDF Processing**:
- Word-based text extraction with tolerance-based alignment
- Contextual spacing analysis for line and paragraph gap classification
- Intelligent block formation using spacing patterns
- Multiple extraction methods (raw text, lines, word-based) for validation

**LLM Analysis** (Azure OpenAI GPT-4.1):
- Strategic page sampling (3 groups + 4 individual pages) for cost efficiency
- Header/footer content-aware detection with confidence scoring
- Section heading identification with numbering pattern analysis
- Table and figure title detection separated from section headings
- Token counting and cost estimation

**Architecture**:
- State machine framework for multi-pass analysis workflows
- Click + Rich CLI with document type profiles (technical, academic, manual, dense)
- Pydantic configuration with environment variable support
- orjson for high-performance JSON serialization

## Pending Issues

**High Priority**:
- Fix duplicate element detection issue: Table titles appearing in both section_headings and table_titles in LLM analysis results

**Low Priority**:
- Minor mkdocs warnings for external links (missing anchors)

## System Status

**Tests**: 87/87 passing (`uv run pytest`)  
**Performance**: 12.5s for 20-page documents, sub-linear scaling validated  
**Build**: Clean (`uv run mkdocs build` succeeds)  
**Documentation**: Dynamic file generation working

## Development Context

**Completed Phases**: See [phase-history.md](phase-history.md)
- Foundation Modernization
- CLI Framework Migration  
- Enhanced Error Handling
- Performance Optimization
- LLM Integration

## Known Technical Debt

- Traditional header/footer detection method (contextual method is preferred)
- PyMuPDF dependency isolation (visualization only, development use)
- Extraction method comparison in production pipeline (consider removal)
