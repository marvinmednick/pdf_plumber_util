# PDF Plumb Project Status

## Current State

**System Status**: Word-based extraction, contextual block formation, spacing gap analysis, LLM-based header/footer detection, LLM section heading and table/figure analysis, state machine architecture for multi-pass analysis  
**Active Work**: State machine integration and documentation improvements complete

## Last Completed Work

**State Machine Integration (Phase 2.4)**:
- State machine workflow is now the default for LLM analysis (`llm-analyze` command)
- Added `--use-direct-analyzer` flag for legacy direct analyzer access  
- Fixed CLI result extraction issue for state machine workflow
- Added reproducible sampling with `--sampling-seed` parameter for testing
- Verified identical LLM requests between state machine and direct analyzer implementations
- Created comprehensive `HeaderFooterAnalysisState` (222 lines) with provider configuration and cost estimation
- Enhanced `LLMDocumentAnalyzer` with sampling seed support for reproducible testing
- Updated state registry and workflow infrastructure
- Created test comparison framework (`test_state_comparison.py`, 254 lines)
- Updated design documentation with loop prevention details and implementation status
- **TODO**: Remove direct analyzer path after validation period

**Work Log Protocol Enhancement**:
- Strengthened CLAUDE.md work log protocol with mandatory immediate documentation requirements
- Enhanced documentation scope to ensure complete coverage of implementation work

## Previous Completed Work

**Documentation Organization and Claude Code Session Guidance**:
- Fixed all incorrect document references in CLAUDE.md (CLI_USAGE.md → docs/cli-usage.md, STATUS.md → docs/status.md, etc.)
- Added WORK_LOG.md to core documentation list
- Created comprehensive Session Startup Guidance section for Claude Code context
- Updated Work Log Protocol to include creating empty WORK_LOG.md after commits
- Established proper workflow for documentation maintenance and session continuity

**LLM Duplicate Element Detection Fix**:
- Fixed critical issue where table titles appeared in both section_headings and table_titles
- Updated LLM prompt with explicit guidance preventing double categorization
- Verified fix with real API call using controlled test fixture (pages 97-99)
- Table 7-2, 7-3, 7-4 now appear ONLY in table_titles category as expected

**Configuration System Enhancement**:
- LLM sampling now properly uses environment variables from .env and config.py
- Added llm_sequence_length configuration parameter for clearer naming
- Renamed group_size → sequence_length throughout sampling system
- All sampling calls now use configured values instead of hardcoded defaults

**Testing Infrastructure Expansion**:
- Created comprehensive pytest tests for overlap-free sampling algorithm (22 new tests)
- Added test fixture generation script for controlled LLM testing scenarios
- All 109 tests passing with robust coverage of sampling edge cases
- Enhanced test documentation following established guidelines

**Documentation Reorganization**:
- Implemented mkdocs-gen-files for dynamic README/CLAUDE.md transformation
- Fixed phase history anchor tags by moving "✅ COMPLETE" status to separate lines
- Resolved mkdocs build warnings for missing readme.md and development.md files
- All documentation now builds successfully with proper link transformation

**State Machine Architecture**:
- Complete state machine orchestrator implementation with AnalysisState base class
- Fixed MAX_TOTAL_STATES constant (50) to prevent infinite loops
- Removed unused retry functionality to simplify codebase (87 tests now passing)

## Current Functionality

**PDF Processing**:
- Word-based text extraction with tolerance-based alignment
- Contextual spacing analysis for line and paragraph gap classification
- Intelligent block formation using spacing patterns
- Multiple extraction methods (raw text, lines, word-based) for validation

**LLM Analysis** (Azure OpenAI GPT-4.1):
- Strategic page sampling (3 groups + 4 individual pages) for cost efficiency
- Header/footer content-aware detection with confidence scoring
- Section heading identification with numbering pattern analysis
- Table and figure title detection separated from section headings
- Token counting and cost estimation

**Architecture**:
- State machine framework for multi-pass analysis workflows
- Click + Rich CLI with document type profiles (technical, academic, manual, dense)
- Pydantic configuration with environment variable support
- orjson for high-performance JSON serialization

## Pending Issues

**High Priority**:
- Fix duplicate element detection issue: Table titles appearing in both section_headings and table_titles in LLM analysis results

**Low Priority**:
- Minor mkdocs warnings for external links (missing anchors)

## System Status

**Tests**: 87/87 passing (`uv run pytest`)  
**Performance**: 12.5s for 20-page documents, sub-linear scaling validated  
**Build**: Clean (`uv run mkdocs build` succeeds)  
**Documentation**: Dynamic file generation working

## Development Context

**Completed Phases**: See [phase-history.md](phase-history.md)
- Foundation Modernization
- CLI Framework Migration  
- Enhanced Error Handling
- Performance Optimization
- LLM Integration

## Known Technical Debt

- Traditional header/footer detection method (contextual method is preferred)
- PyMuPDF dependency isolation (visualization only, development use)
- Extraction method comparison in production pipeline (consider removal)
