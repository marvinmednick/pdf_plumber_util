## Development Philosophy Evolution

### Iterative Validation Approach
Throughout all phases, PDF Plumb has followed a consistent pattern:
1. **Implement Multiple Approaches**: Create alternatives for comparison and validation
2. **Compare and Test**: Use real-world documents to validate approaches
3. **Choose Best Solution**: Select optimal approach based on evidence
4. **Standardize Implementation**: Focus on chosen approach while retaining validation methods

### Examples of Iterative Development
- **Extraction Methods**: Multiple methods implemented → Word-based chosen as primary
- **Header/Footer Detection**: Traditional + Contextual → Contextual validated as preferred  
- **CLI Framework**: argparse → Click migration with compatibility validation
- **Error Handling**: Basic → Structured exceptions with Rich formatting
- **Performance**: Standard json → orjson with performance validation

### Quality Assurance Principles
- **Real-World Testing**: Validation using actual technical documents
- **Compatibility Verification**: Ensure changes don't break existing functionality
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Preserve design decisions and rationale
- **Maintainable Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns and modular design
